1. Problem Statement

Modern healthcare systems generate large volumes of patient data, but manual monitoring is inefficient, error-prone, and cannot provide timely alerts during emergencies. Patients with chronic conditions require continuous monitoring, which is often not feasible in traditional hospital setups.
There is a need for an automated smart health monitoring system that can track vital parameters in real-time, detect anomalies, and provide medical professionals with timely insights.

2. Scope of the Project

The project focuses on building a Smart Health Monitoring System that:
 Collects key vital signs such as heart rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation (SpO₂).
 Analyzes health data automatically using predefined thresholds.
 Generates alerts when abnormal conditions are detected.
 Stores patient data securely in a database.
 Provides APIs for integration with external healthcare systems.
 Offers an intuitive workflow and modular design for further expansion.

3. Target Users

The system is designed for:
Hospitals & Clinics – for automated patient monitoring
Doctors & Medical Staff – to receive timely alerts
Patients – especially those requiring remote monitoring
Family Members/Caregivers – to track a patient’s condition
Health-Tech Developers/Researchers – for integration and experimentation

4. High-Level Features

Real-time Data Monitoring: Continuously tracks vital health parameters.
Automated Alert System: Detects anomalies and triggers notifications.
Secure Data Storage: Uses a reliable database for patient records.
REST API Support: Backend endpoints for integration and data access.
User Management: Add, update, and manage patient information.
Health Analytics Dashboard (optional extension): View historical data trends.
Scalable Architecture: Built with modular components allowing future upgrades.
